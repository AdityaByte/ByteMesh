Simulated Distributed file system in golang.
A Simulated Distributed File System (Simulated DFS) is a file system that mimics a true DFS but runs on a single machine rather than multiple nodes. It simulates the behavior of a real DFS (like Hadoop HDFS, Google File System, or Ceph) without actually distributing data across multiple physical servers.
