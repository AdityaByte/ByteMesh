# ByteMesh - A Distributed File System (DFS) in Go  

**ByteMesh** is a **Distributed File System (DFS)** built using **Golang**, designed to provide **scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient file storage across multiple machines**. Unlike traditional DFS implementations such as **Hadoop HDFS, Google File System (GFS), or Ceph**, ByteMesh offers a **lightweight yet powerful distributed storage system** with a **TCP-based client-server architecture**.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

âœ… **True Distributed Storage** â€“ The server can be deployed on multiple machines, handling distributed file storage.  
âœ… **TCP-Based Client-Server Communication** â€“ Uses raw TCP sockets for high-performance data transfer.  
âœ… **Metadata Management** â€“ A dedicated metadata service tracks file locations, replication, and integrity.  
âœ… **File Chunking & Replication** â€“ Files are split into chunks and distributed across nodes for redundancy.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Designed to scale by adding more storage nodes.
